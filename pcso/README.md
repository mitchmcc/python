Application Overview

PCSOcalls is a community policing-oriented blog for residents of Pinellas County, Florida.
The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) has a great web site feature called "Active Calls",
which shows you in near-real time each call they are on, with the severity, problem description,
and locality.

The PCSOcalls application is a computer program that "scrapes" the Active Calls page, and
emails the data to people who have subscribed to receive information about the same.

The way it works is simple.  You can subscribe to getting emails one of two ways: by Priority,
or by a Wildcard, in the locality you request.

For example, you can sign up to get all "HIGH" priority calls in your town of LARGO, or
all "MEDIUM" calls in "COUNTY".  The priorities and localities are exactly as they appear
on the PCSO web site: http://www.pcsoweb.com/active-calls/.    Or, you could decide that you want an email any time that the word
"ROBBERY" appears in the problem description in your town of DUNEDIN.  Whenever that
happens, you would get an email.

The volume of emails you might expect to receive is, of course, dependent upon how you set
up your email parameters, and the actual (unknown!) volume of calls that are recorded.
